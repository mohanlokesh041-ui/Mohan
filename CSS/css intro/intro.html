        <p>Dhoni was born on 7 July 1981 in Ranchi, Bihar (now in Jharkhand) in a Hindu Rajput 
            family to Pan Singh and Devaki Devi.[2][3] His parents hailed from Lwali village in 
            Uttar Pradesh (now Uttarakhand) and he was the youngest of three children.[4][5][6] His 
            family spells the surname as "Dhauni".[7] The spelling "Dhoni" emerged due to a spelling 
            mistake in his school certificates and, despite repeated attempts by his family, has never been rectified.
