            Kabaddi (/kəˈbædi/,[2] /ˈkʌbədi/)[3] is a contact team sport played between two teams of seven players. 
            It is one of the traditional games of South Asia.[4] In this game, a raider enters the opposing half of 
            the court to touch defenders and attempt to return within 30 seconds without being tackled. Points are 
            awarded for successful tags, while defenders earn a point for stopping the raider. Tagged or tackled 
            players are temporarily out but can re-enter when their team scores. Raids alternate between teams 
            throughout the game.
