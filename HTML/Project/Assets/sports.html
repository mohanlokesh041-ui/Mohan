    <h1>Major Sports Issues In Chennai</h1>
<div>
    <h2>Poor Sports Infrastructure & Maintenance</h2>
    <ul>
     <li>Many public playgrounds and corporation‑run sports fields have equipment that is old, rusted, or broken. Some are locked up for seemingly no reason. 
The Times of India</li>

<li>Synthetic tracks are sometimes delayed or stalled due to legal issues or problems in tender processes. 
The New Indian Express</li>

<li>Playgrounds often lack basic amenities: lighting, fencing, proper flooring, clean changing rooms/restrooms.</li>
    </ul>
    </div>

        <h2>Scarcity of Playgrounds Shrinking Open Spaces</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>As urban development intensifies, open spaces and playgrounds are being reduced, repurposed, or encroached upon.</li>
            <li>In certain neighbourhoods (especially southern Chennai: Pallavaram, Chromepet, Pammal), there are few good quality playgrounds, forcing children to play on streets.</li>
        </ul>
    </main>

    <h2>Lack of Facilities for Specific Sports</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Throwing events (javelin, discus, hammer, etc.) suffer because there are not enough dedicated spaces; many stadiums are used mostly for other sports like football. When it rains, tracks or fields get muddy and unusable.</li>
        <li>Wheelchair sports and sports for differently‑abled persons: accessibility is poor, awareness is low.</li>
    </ul>
